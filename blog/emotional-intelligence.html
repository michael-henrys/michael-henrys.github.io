        <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>

        <P>19 September 2021</P>

        <h4>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>

        <p>
            Emotional Intelligence is defined by Peter Salovey and John Mayer as:
        </p>

        <em>
            "the capacity to reason about emotions, and of emotions, to enhance thinking. It includes the abilities to accurately perceive emotions, to access and generate emotions so as to assist thought, to understand emotions and emotional knowledge, and to reflectively regulate emotions so as to promote emotional and intellectual growth."
        </em>

        <p>
            (John D. Mayer, Peter Salovey & David R. Caruso (2004) TARGET ARTICLES: "Emotional Intelligence: Theory, Findings, and Implications", Psychological Inquiry, 15:3, 197-215)
        </p>

        <p>
            This definition describes emotional intelligence as a collection of interrelated abilities. The first of these is the ability to 'accurately perceive emotions'. This is essentially just being able to recognize emotions in faces, voices and things. It also includes the ability for us to perceive our own emotions accurately. Secondly, is the 'Ability to access and generate emotions so as to assist thought'. This is basically just harnessing our changing emotions and moods to help us with certain tasks. I think this what people talk about when they say they are 'channeling'  a particular emotion. For example channelling frustration to work out harder. Thirdly is the ability to 'Understand emotions and emotional knowledge'. This is more than just being able to accurately perceive a particular emotion, but is the ability to notice subtle changes in emotions and predict how they change over time through experience. Lastly is the ability to 'regulate emotions'. This is about having good control over your emotions and being able to manage and manipulate them in order to help yourself achieve certain things.

        <h4>How is it different to IQ? </h4>
        
        <p>
            IQ is the total score derived from a set of standardized tests or subtests designed to assess human intelligence. There are many different ways measuring IQ, but generally it is associated with a persons logical reasoning ability. It is the kind of intelligence that is required for traditional academic activities. This is often considered to be quite a narrow way of measuring human intelligence because it doesn't include emotional and creative forms of intelligence. Emotional intelligence aims to fill in one of the biggest gaps that IQ leaves in terms of quantifying intelligence. While there are some methods for measuring emotional intelligence, it is controversial as there are many differing approaches. I think for me it is more useful to think about emotional intelligence as something to aspire to and work towards developing, rather than something to measure.  
        </p>

        <h4>Why is it important?</h4>

        <p>
            Emotional intelligence is really important for two main reasons. The first reason is that it helps our individual wellbeing. Emotional intelligence can enable us to work better and more effectively without being as influenced by emotions when things go wrong or unpredictable things happen in our lives. A recent example would be in dealing with Covid-19 lockdowns. Being able to check in with our emotions and regulate them can help deal with the uncertainty and the added stress of Covid-19, allowing us to continue to work and improve general wellbeing during this difficult time. It also is also very healthy to be in touch with our emotional sides even when there are no difficulties to deal with. The second reason is for that it helps us work better together. Having emotional intelligence and better understanding the emotions of the people we are working with is very important for working in a team and being a part of a community. It helps us communicate in ways that are suited to the emotions of those around us. It is especially important for helping those who may be having a tough time emotionally. Being able to recognize and understand their emotions enables us know when people around us might need help. We can also use our own understanding of emotions to predict behaviors of others better and navigate social situations.
