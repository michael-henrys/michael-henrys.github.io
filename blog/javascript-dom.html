        <h2>Javascript Fundamentals</h2>

        <h4>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h4>

        <p>
            HTML is like a the screenwriter for a film. They write a script with all the lines for all the actors. They also write the stage directions, instructions for who goes where and what they are meant to do. The script by itself is not really ready for consumption. It has to be performed for it to really shine. CSS is the film director, the person responsible for ensuring the script shines as bright as possible. The director makes all the final creative decisions about how the film will look. They decide what camera angles, framing, colors, and costumes are used. They are also responsible for guiding the actors to behave and speak in a certain way. A good director is nothing without a good script and vice versa.

        <h4>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life.</h4>

        <p>
            Control flow is kind of like cooking while following a recipe. You follow the steps one at a time. Some times the recipe will ask you repeat some steps. You might have a lot of vegetables that need to be battered and fried, but your frier can only fit a few at a time. So you repeat the steps - batter and fry, batter and fry, etc etc... until you are all the way through all the vegetables. After this you break out of the loop and resume the normal flow of the recipe. One step at a time.

        <h4>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h4>

        <p>
            The DOM stands for document object model. Basically this is how the browser understands all of the pieces of a web page. The DOM is a tree structure. This is like a family tree or a species diagram. At the top you have the great grandparent, the big old document itself. Then the document has the body and head as its children and each of those have other children that make up the page. Some of those elements might have children of their own. For example a menu is made up of lots of the individual links. You can use javascript to retrieve elements from the DOM. This allows you to modify those elements to respond to user interaction. For example changing the some some text on the page when the user presses a button.  
        </p>

        <h4>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h4>

        <p>
            Each piece of data in an array has a special number called an index. Each item that gets added to an array gets the next number available. The first index is 0 and then 1,2,3... until you run out of data. You can access the data from the array by giving the index of the data that you are looking for. This is like looking up a page in a book. With an array you have to know the exact page number you are looking for, otherwise you'll have to go through each one at a time until you find the page you want.
        </p>

        <p>
            Arrays are really good if you have a list of things you want to store but it can quickly get confusing if the book is really long with lots of different sections. This is where objects come in handy. With an object you can store your data in a more structured way. Each piece of data stored in an object is called a property. A property has two parts: The first part is the name of the property, and the second part is the actual value of the data. The name is like a magic key that unlocks the data itself. 
        </p>

        <h4>Explain what functions are and why they are useful</h4>

        <p>
            A function is like a bit of code that can be reused over and over again. Functions can have certain pieces of input which are called arguments and sometimes they return output. This is very handy if you have a task that you wanted repeated often in your code. This means you don't have to type it out over and over again. You can simply call it by using the name of the function. Functions are also a very good way of organizing your code into different pieces each with a different purpose.
