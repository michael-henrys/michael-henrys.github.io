        <h2>Foundations Reflection</h2>

        <P>29 September 2021</P>

        <h4>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning? </h4>

        <p>
            Firstly I learned that I am likely to avoid tasks that I consider myself having a ‘fixed’ level of ability at. For example, I don't avoid tech tasks because I believe I can get better and improve my ability to program and I have proven that to myself countless times. On the other hand, reflective writing and journaling is something that I always imagined I was inherently ill equipped to do. This belief is not correct, but it often guided a lot of my motivation and willingness to engage with the core content. Secondly I learned I was worse at asking for help than I imagined I was. I learned that my ego gets in the way of me reaching out and admitting I am stuck for fear of appearing unintelligent. I think this is one of my biggest insecurities and a lot of my negative self talk revolves around being perceived by others as stupid or unsuccessful. Thirdly I learned that I operate best when I have a predefined schedule. This is primarily because when I have no plan and am wondering what to do next I can quickly slump into a lethargic mood and look for ways to procrastinate. It also makes it much easier to relax when you have blocked out time for work because you know you don’t have to think about it the rest of the time. I have found implementing a better calendar schedule to be a really effective time management strategy.  
        </p>

        <h4>What are the roles of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h4>

        <p>
            Values provide a high level guide for people on their learning journey. Especially in an area as broad and far reaching as programming. Values can help us identify what we want to achieve with our learning and what sort of work we want to be doing. Values can also be a way we can connect with others. It is easy to identify the kind of workplace culture and people we want to work with if we can clearly define our own values and see where they overlap. This also ties into empathy. Being able to understand how we feel in ourselves and understanding the feelings of others helps us to communicate more effectively. We can use that understanding to communicate in a way that respects the feelings of others and reflects our own feelings. In this way empathy is very important for working in a group. This is necessary for learning and for programming because these are often team activities. Self awareness is very useful in learning because it helps us identify the areas where we can improve. This directs our learning and allows us to focus our attention on the areas where it is necessary. 
        </p>

        <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>

        <p>
            What surprised me most about learning core is the fact that I learned so much about myself in the process. I had always assumed I knew myself pretty well, despite not really dedicating much time to reflecting on who I am and what my strengths and weaknesses are. I was also surprised about how quickly I noticed the things I had learned in core start to inform my everyday decisions and work habits and lead me to being generally happier and having better mental health. 
        </p>

        <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>

        <p>
            I found that it took a lot more time than I was expecting. This was due to the fact that I often found myself avoiding the longer reflective writing tasks simply because I believed I wasn’t good at that kind of thing. I found getting over this motivational hump and reminding myself that I could do it to be one of the biggest challenges. I also think a lot of the core learning involves self criticism which can be a difficult thing to do. It is confronting thinking about and discussing your own flaws from your ego's perspective. This was another reason that I think I sometimes found myself putting off the core until the last couple of days of each sprint. Despite these challenges I am really glad I took the time to engage with more intentional reflective practice because I think the benefits are immeasurable. Not only is it useful to be able to reflect on my strengths and weaknesses in the context of dev academy, but by practicing this I can apply it to other areas of my life more easily. 
        </p>

        <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h4>

        <p>
            I think firstly that programming work and tech work in general is stressful and demanding of the human psyche. Even the most hardened and experienced programmer will sometimes need to deal with high stress work environments and potentially long hours of work. It is essential when working in this kind of environment to have the tools to cope with managing stress and heavy workloads. Furthermore programming is a very collaborative and team based industry therefore it makes sense to focus on core skills that will allow learners to work in teams more effectively. While the stereotype of socially awkward nerdy programmers working in a dark room is very outdated it does sometimes have an element of truth. A lot of people who are drawn to programming because of their logical minds and technical abilities haven’t had many opportunities to develop their human skills. By giving people an opportunity to do this dev academy is setting people up better for work in the industry. 
        </p>

        <h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h4>

        <p>
            I definitely don’t think the time spent studying core has been a waste at all. I have already spent a lot of time practicing programming at uni and I found the technical part of the course didn’t take up heaps of my time. This meant I had a lot of time left to focus on core and I didn’t feel as though the core was taking away any time I could have been spending on tech. I really enjoyed the core part of the course because it challenged me to think about myself  in ways I hadn’t thought about myself before. Aside from the benefits of this kind of critical thinking practice, I think all the extra time writing and practicing articulating myself has been very valuable. I think the core component of this course has been anything but a waste of time and is an integral part of what makes the EDA experience so valuable and refreshing as a learning model in comparison to a lot of my other education experiences.
