        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>

        <P>26 September 2021</P>

        <h4>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h4>

        <p>
            Emotional Intelligence is defined by Peter Salovey and John Mayer as:
        </p>

        <h4>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h4>

        <p>
            Neuroplasticity is the ability for the brain to adapt and change in response to stimuli. This is the mechanism responsible for learning and memory retention. When you learning something new it causes a particular set of neurons to fire together. By practicing something you you are doing this repeatedly which strengthens those connections and makes the new learning easier to recall. Understanding how this works is very important for two reasons: 
        </p>

        <P>
            Firstly, by simply knowing that your brain can grow and change as you learn, you can significantly improve your ability to learn. This was demonstrated in 2007 by Lisa Blackwell, Kali Trzesniewski, Carol Dweck in their 2007 paper <em>"Implicit Theories of Intelligence Predict Achievement Across an Adolescent Transition: A Longitudinal Study and an Intervention"</em>. The researchers found that in a Study with 373 7th graders, the belief that intelligence is malleable predicted an upward trajectory in grades over the two years of junior high school, while a belief that intelligence is fixed predicted a flat trajectory. 
        </P>

       <P>
            Secondly, knowing the mechanisms behind neuroplasticity can help you implement learning strategies that take advantage of them. For example, understanding that learning happens when connections are made between ideas encourages us to try and put our learning in context and find analogies and links between different things. This can be integrated into reflections 'after' learning. Knowing that connections are strengthened through repeated practice can guide us to focus on practical exercises that emphasize repetition for things that we struggle to remember. 
       </P>

       <h4> What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h4>

       <p>
            One of the ways that kept coming up in my research was meditation and mindfulness. In this <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2944261/">article</a>  researchers demonstrate using a sample of Tibetan Buddhist monks that long term meditation practice can lead to permanent changes in the physical structure of the brain and in brain function related to focus and attention. Another <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1361002/">study</a> shows that long term meditation increases 'cortical thickness'. It was found that "Brain regions associated with attention, interoception and sensory processing were thicker in meditation participants than matched controls".  However, in order to see these benefits you have to practice meditation regularly for a long time. After seeing at this research I am now much more likely to do that! 
       </p>

       <p>
            Other than that, you can increase neuroplasticity by trying some of the things I have already discussed: practicing things repeatedly and intentionally and regularly to solidify the connections between neurons and reflective contextualizing of learning.
        </p>

        <h4>Discuss what Growth Mindset is and why it is relevant
        </h4>
        
        <p>
            The growth mindset is rooted in understanding neuroplasticity. The growth mindset is simply embracing and believing in ones own ability to improve and grow. This is especially important for learning. Perhaps the growth mindset is best understood as antithetical to the fixed mindset. The fixed mindset is believing that your abilities are unchangeable. This means that you avoid trying to learn new skills because you are unable to see yourself as improving at them. It also means you are easily discouraged by failure as indicative of your fixed ability. By adopting the growth mindset you are able to overcome these challenges. You will be less likely to avoid starting new things and see failures and criticism for what they are, as growth opportunities. The growth mindset and fixed mindsets are not permanent and someone can have a different mindset from moment to moment, therefore it is important to practice adopting a growth mindset especially in areas where your fixed mindset might be more entrenched. 
        </p>

        <h4>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h4>

        <p>
            I am already very familiar with the growth mindset having read Carol Dweck's book. I think it always good to be reminded of the fundamentals though. I think exploring this again has just solidified my understanding of the growth mindset and motivated me to continue pursuing a growth mindset in as many parts of my life as I can. 
        </p>

        <h4>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h4>

        <p>
            I think the biggest two areas where it is applicable are in terms of general motivation and in accepting criticism and failure. Firstly by regularly reminding myself of neuroplasticity and the growth mindset (perhaps by integrating it into my mindfulness practice) I think I will find enthusiasm for my learning. It will encourage me because it helps me see the potential in learning and helps me see how achievable learning is are rather than only seeing learning as a series of ever more impassable obstacles.
