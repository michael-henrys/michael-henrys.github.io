        <h2>Problem Solving</h2>

        <P>26 September 2021</P>

        <h4>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you got blocked on a simple problem.  </h4>

        <p>
            During the sprint-4 kata exercises I was initially very blocked on the `capitalize` function for the Built-in Methods exercise. This task required us to write code that took some text in and then capitalized the first letter of each word. The first problem solving technique I tried was just trying something. This didn't quite work though so I ended up Googling. This allowed me to see how other people had solved similar problems. This technique was successful. During the process I felt confused and frustrated at first since I didn't completely understand the problem and hadn't read enough of the instructions. When I was Googling and finding a solution I felt excited because I could see how to solve the problem. When I managed to solve it I felt satisfied and proud. I learned during this process that I should always read the exercise brief carefully and look at the unit tests to see what is required before I try and solve a problem. I also learned that Googling is a valid and important problem solving technique that can be applied to most coding issues.

            For the same exercise I was also stuck on how to do the `deBee` function. For this task I had to write some code that took a sentence and removed all instances the words 'buzz' from it. I tried the reading error messages problem solving technique for this problem. I initially thought I had finished the task but it was giving me an error message that said I had to remove all of the buzzes regardless of capitalization. This means that I needed to be able to remove variations of buzz like 'BuzZ' and 'BUzz' for example. This stumped me a little bit because in order to filter these words out I have to compare each word to the word 'buzz', if it is equal then it gets removed from the sentence. This comparison is case sensitive so I initially thought that I would have to check from every possible case variation of buzz. I then applied the trying something problem solving technique and thought if I just capitalized every letter in each word and then compared it to 'BUZZ' then I would catch every possible variation. This worked because it would just skip letters that are already capitalized and then only capitalize the lower case letters so every possible version of 'buZz' would become 'BUZZ' and then so it would remove all of them with me only having to do one comparison. This made me feel very capable when I found the solution. I learned in this exercise that I sometimes I should trust myself and be confident in trying solutions before I do anything else.

        <h4>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Pseudocode: I have used Pseudocode a lot before. I find it very useful for sketching out solutions before tackling a difficult problem. It is also very useful if you are trying to communicate coding ideas quickly to teach something or to solve problems in a group.</li>
            <li>Trying something: I feel as though I could be better at just trying potential solutions. I often find I lack some of the confidence I should have in my coding ability. Often you can set up a coding environment so that there is very little that could go wrong if you get a solution wrong at first. I need to be less afraid of making mistakes because this is how learning takes place and is the only way to get to a solution. I think I often use this lack of confidence as an excuse to procrastinate and avoid doing difficult things. I thing this is an area that I really want to work on.</li>
            <li>Rubber ducky method: This is something I don't have a lot of experience with, although I know it is a very popular technique used by software developers. I think I intuitively do something similar when I encounter a bug or a problem by just going through my code line by line and explaining it to myself. I think this is usually the way I approach debugging although I don't really do it as methodically as I should. I think I could try and use this technique in a more formal and structured way, forcing myself to explain every line rather than just the bits I don't understand as much. I think often bugs are hiding in the parts of the code I feel confident about and this hubris is sometimes my downfall. </li>
            <li>Reading error messages: I consider myself to be pretty adept at reading error messages. I have been coding for a while so a lot of the jargon is familiar to me and I understand how to follow the call stack. Sometimes this particular technique is good when it is combined with Googling. </li>
            <li>Console.logging: I personally like this technique a lot even though we were discouraged from doing it at uni. We were told to use debugging tools that were often ways of doing the same thing. For quickly finding the location of a bug it is invaluable. It is a good way to see what the value of a variable is a certain point in the code or even just checking if the control flow has reached a certain function or loop. Although in different languages that I have learned it is not known as console.logging, I think I am confident doing it and applying it to web development in javascript.</li>
            <li>Googling: This one is another favorite of mine that has never really failed. Unlike console.logging, rubber ducky debugging, and reading error messages, googling something is less about finding the source of an issue and is more about finding a solution to a problem. This can be good when you are just totally perplexed by an error message or a bug. However, I don't think it should be a last resort and there is no shame in googling something to refresh your memory or even to see how someone else has tackled a similar problem. Effective googling in the context of programming sometimes requires a certain understanding of the jargon and terms programmers might use. Also be prepared to try different variations of the same search query and to check out a few of the search results before giving up. It is very rare that you can't find some sort of help for your problem by googling it. I feel pretty confident using this problem solving technique. </li>
            <li>Asking your peers for help: This is something I could be better at. I'm not always very comfortable reaching out to people I don't already know quite well. I also don't want to feel like an imposition on other people which might also impair my ability to use this technique. Furthermore I think pride can sometimes get in the way of asking for help, especially from peers. Asking for help from peers means you have to be able to admit that you don't know everything and are struggling, which can be difficult if you are like to appear knowledgeable and capable. </li>
            <li>Asking coaches for help: Similarly asking for help from coaches can be intimidating if you don't know them that well. It can sometimes be easier admitting that you don't know something to a coach because they are already expected to have a much higher skill level though. Again this is an area I want to improve on. </li>
            <li>Improving your process with reflection: I think this is another area for me to stretch in. I think I could always better at both giving and receiving feedback to myself. I need to practice going back and reviewing code I have written; As a means of both understanding it better, and finding things to improve and refactor. </li>        
        </ul>
