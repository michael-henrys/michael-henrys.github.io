        <h2>Bootcamp learning plan</h2>

        <p>3 October 2021</p>

        <h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>

        <p>
            I am interested in using the web development skills I am learning to create apps that will help people with everyday tasks. I am also interested in data science and data visualisation so I want to create web apps that help communicate data in an interesting and innovative way. I am also becoming more and more interested in the idea of working on open source projects so this is something I wish to cultivate more and more. 
        </p>

        <h4>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h4>

        <p>
            I think identifying communication skills as a potential strength in my earlier learning plan was correct. I think written communication is a strength. However I seem to have cognitive dissonance about this when it comes to finding the motivation to write. As I mentioned in the core reflection I need to work on having more self belief when it comes to my ability to write well so I can overcome my avoidance of writing tasks. Being able to write well will help with bootcamp in relation to my communication of ideas with others, but also in relation to my reflective writing and journaling which will be an effective supplement to my learning. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I mentioned listening skills as a potential weakness in the sprint-2 learning plan. I think this still rings true and I often find myself too engrossed in what I want to communicate to fully actively and mindfully listen to others. I look forward to doing more active listening tasks to try and improve my emotional intelligence in this area. This will help during bootcamp because I will be working a lot more with others and I want to be able to fully appreciate and consider all the different voices and ideas. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Another strength that I have identified during the foundations course is my self awareness. I am actually surprisingly better at self reflection and identifying my own strengths and weaknesses than I anticipated. This is very useful for learning because it allows me to continually find areas to improve in and allows me to be mindful of my impact on those around me.
        </p>

        <p>
            As I discussed in the core reflection blog I learned that I am not great at asking for help in a timely manner, choosing instead to hyperfixate on solving a problem by myself. This is something I will need to work on during bootcamp, because while it is good to be independent, it is not worth wasting so much of my time when there are people around me to guide me towards solutions. I need to be better at admitting I don’t know things and not let my ego get in the way. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Another area for development that I identified during the foundations course is time management. I think because so much of the work was self-directed and I was working from home I found it harder than I expected to get into good routines and not leave a lot of the work till the very last minute. This was definitely to my detriment. However I think I also developed a good strategy for dealing with it as I discussed in my foundations reflection blog. Planning ahead and developing a good schedule for my week has made a drastic improvement. I will be continuing to implement strategies for improving my time management habits. 
        </p>

        <h4>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h4>

        <p>
            Staying focussed and subsequently staying on top of my work for the full nine weeks will be the biggest non-technical challenge. I sometimes struggle with motivational slumps where I find it hard to focus on my work. The risk of this happening over a nine week period of time is quite high and I want to make sure I am well equipped to deal with this. These slumps can happen for a variety of reasons such as anxiety, poor time management, burnout and general lack of direction. I am hoping that the engaging nature of bootcamp will help me find more of that direction and will help mitigate some of those factors. I have been able to deal with these things effectively during foundations so I will try and take the coping strategies I have developed forward into the bootcamp. 
        </p>

        <h4>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>

        <p>
            I really look forward to developing more teamwork skills. I feel as though I need more practice in this area. I also want to continue to develop better time management strategies and general work habits. Another area I really want to develop is my ability to receive and give feedback. Leadership is also something I want to explore and embrace. I feel as though in the past I have avoided leadership because I haven’t considered myself worthy of those roles.
        </p>

        <h4>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h4>

        <p>
            To me support looks like being able to voice my concerns and talk to someone in confidence. Support looks like an open door. I don’t think support is hand-holding, I think good support encourages independence. 
        </p>

       <h4>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h4> 

       <p>
           A lot of this remains unchanged from the earlier learning plan. In order to manage my own workload I will ensure I am practicing a healthy balance of work and relaxation. Yoga, meditation, and socializing are ways I can recharge my energy and reduce stress. I will also try and cultivate a growth mindset. I will try to see the challenges I face as opportunities to learn and grow. I will make sure I take the lessons from foundations on board and ensure I am planning my schedule ahead of time so I can stay on top of the workload in terms of time management.  I will also be honest about how I am feeling to my facilitator and friends and listen to any advice I receive. 
       </p>

       <p>
           If working in a team I will participate actively and do my fair share of the workload. I will set reasonable goals and expectations when working in a team. I will quickly admit if I am failing to meet those goals to others in a team and to myself and work on managing expectations that are more accurate. I will be kind and communicate clearly when providing feedback and managing expectations of others. I will respect and value the ideas and opinions of other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives. I will be open to receiving feedback and if anyone is made to feel uncomfortable through any of my actions I will not hesitate to change that behavior.
       </p>

       <p>
           If I am unable to solve a roadblock issue on my own within a reasonable amount of time, one or two 25 minutes blocks then I will seek help in the foundations slack, the code help-desk, and ask my facilitator if those channels don't work out. I will also reach out to my facilitator or a member of the team when I am facing non technical issues that are preventing me from working. I will do this as soon as I notice myself being unable to work effectively - in a preventative way - rather than after it's too late. Knowing how much time to spend solving particular problems is something I will need to work on.
       </p>

        
        <h2>learning Plan</h2>

        <P>10 September 2021</P>

        <h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>

        <p>I want to have a career that incorporates my interests in user experience and data science. I would like be able to create interactive platforms that communicate complicated ideas and data in exciting and engaging ways.</p>

        <h4>description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning.</h4>

        <p>I think my strengths of communication and facilitation will be very useful for both learning and career development. I hope to use these skills to help me when working in teams and groups. I hope to also use them to help others and to take on a mentoring or training role, both at dev academy and also further down the track in my career. I think my limited ability to fully listen and engage with others could be an obstacle to my learning and also to my career. I need to be able to listen better if I am to get the most out of learning. Good Time management and finding a strong focus will also be something that needs to be worked on for me to learn better and develop a successful career in tech.</p>

        <h4>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>skills for working in a team</li>
            <li>Mentoring and teaching skills</li> 
            <li>Giving and receiving constructive feedback</li>
            <li>Better work habits and stronger focus</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>A commitment to managing my workload in a team.</h4>

        <p>If working in a team I will participate actively and do my fair share of the workload. I will set reasonable goals and expectations when working in a team. I will quickly admit if I am failing to meet those goals to others in a team and to myself and work on managing expectations that are more accurate. I will be kind and communicate clearly when providing feedback and managing expectations of others. I will respect and value the ideas and opinions of other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives. I will be open to receiving feedback and if anyone is made to feel uncomfortable through any of my actions I will not hesitate to change that behavior.</p>
        
        <h4>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h4>

        <p>I will take time to pause and reflect on my situation and ensure I am practicing a healthy balance of work and relaxation. Yoga, meditation, and socializing are ways I can recharge my energy and reduce stress. I will also try and cultivate a growth mindset. I will try and see the challenges I face as opportunities to learn and grow. I will also be honest about how I am feeling to my facilitator and friends and listen to any advice I receive.</p>

        <p>If I am unable to solve an roadblock issue on my own within a reasonable amount of time, one or two 25 minutes blocks then I will seek help in the foundations slack, the code help-desk, and ask my facilitator if those channels don't work out. I will also reach out to my facilitator or a member of the team when I am facing non technical issues that are preventing me from working. I will do this as soon as I notice myself being unable to work effectively - in a preventative way - rather than after it's too already too late. Knowing how much time to spend solving particular problems is something I will need to work on.</p>

        <p>I expect support and mentoring for both technical issues, but also for issues related to my wellbeing and work habits. However, I understand that the facilitation team is not superhuman and I do not expect them to find solutions for me, but rather to guide me towards finding solutions for myself. I will ensure I am not unreasonably demanding or expect them to answer every question I have.</p>
