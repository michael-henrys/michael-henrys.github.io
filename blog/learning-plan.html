        <h2>learning Plan</h2>

        <h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>

        <p>I want to have a career that incorporates my interests in user experience and data science. I would like be able to create interactive platforms that communicate complicated ideas and data in exciting and engaging ways.</p>

        <h4>description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning.</h4>

        <p>I think my strengths of communication and facilitation will be very useful for both learning and career development. I hope to use these skills to help me when working in teams and groups. I hope to also use them to help others and to take on a mentoring or training role, both at dev academy and also further down the track in my career. I think my limited ability to fully listen and engage with others could be an obstacle to my learning and also to my career. I need to be able to listen better if I am to get the most out of learning. Good Time management and finding a strong focus will also be something that needs to be worked on for me to learn better and develop a successful career in tech.</p>

        <h4>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>skills for working in a team</li>
            <li>Mentoring and teaching skills</li> 
            <li>Giving and receiving constructive feedback</li>
            <li>Better work habits and stronger focus</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>A commitment to managing my workload in a team.</h4>

        <p>If working in a team I will participate actively and do my fair share of the workload. I will set reasonable goals and expectations when working in a team. I will quickly admit if I am failing to meet those goals to others in a team and to myself and work on managing expectations that are more accurate. I will be kind and communicate clearly when providing feedback and managing expectations of others. I will respect and value the ideas and opinions of other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives. I will be open to receiving feedback and if anyone is made to feel uncomfortable through any of my actions I will not hesitate to change that behavior.</p>
        
        <h4>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h4>

        <p>I will take time to pause and reflect on my situation and ensure I am practicing a healthy balance of work and relaxation. Yoga, meditation, and socializing are ways I can recharge my energy and reduce stress. I will also try and cultivate a growth mindset. I will try and see the challenges I face as opportunities to learn and grow. I will also be honest about how I am feeling to my facilitator and friends and listen to any advice I receive.</p>

        <p>If I am unable to solve an roadblock issue on my own within a reasonable amount of time, one or two 25 minutes blocks then I will seek help in the foundations slack, the code help-desk, and ask my facilitator if those channels don't work out. I will also reach out to my facilitator or a member of the team when I am facing non technical issues that are preventing me from working. I will do this as soon as I notice myself being unable to work effectively - in a preventative way - rather than after it's too already too late. Knowing how much time to spend solving particular problems is something I will need to work on.</p>

        <p>I expect support and mentoring for both technical issues, but also for issues related to my wellbeing and work habits. However, I understand that the facilitation team is not superhuman and I do not expect them to find solutions for me, but rather to guide me towards finding solutions for myself. I will ensure I am not unreasonably demanding or expect them to answer every question I have.</p>
