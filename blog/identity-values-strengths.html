        <h2>Identity, Values and Strengths</h2>

        <P>10 September 2021</P>

        <h4>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values</h4>
        <p>
            I look up from my desk while working from home and I see I am surrounded by many houseplants. Plants inspire
            me to grow. The slow pace of plant life - growing steadily while feeding off water, sun, and soil - inspires
            me to be mindful of the journey I am on. Nourishing and cultivating things can help them grow and expand
            into even more beautiful things. This is an example of how I value nature as and the environment as a whole.
            I have always enjoyed being outside ever since I was very young. My most treasured memories are tramping and
            camping in Aotearoa's National Parks. I value a symbiotic relationship with nature and I want to work with
            nature as opposed to against it. I am a climate change activist and keen gardener when I can find the time
            and energy.
        </p>
        <p>
            This symbiosis goes beyond plants and animals. I also believe very strongly in the power of community. I
            think in our current age humanity suffers greatly from a chronic deficiency of community. The individual
            person is inextricably linked to the collective they are a part of. We are shaped and are ultimately a
            reflection of our community. It is precisely because of this that we have responsibility to care for and
            give love to those around us; our family, WhƒÅnau, friends, and wider society. I believe that we have a
            responsibility to help those who are marginalized and oppressed by dominant structures of power. We must
            resist these structures and stand for justice.
        </p>
        <p><em>"If we want a beloved community, we must stand for justice." - Bell Hooks</em></p>
        <p>
            For me, community should be something that celebrates and upholds diversity and individuality rather than
            suppresses it. The collective should never be a homogenous lump. Empathy and respect for one another's
            individuality should be at the core of any community.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some examples that demonstrate my value of community are by volunteering with the Aro Valley Community
            Council, briefly sitting on their organizing committee and through other political activism and campaigning.
            I also am very passionate about my local music community and I have also organized and promoted gigs. Music
            and dance is an integral part of community for me. I enjoy a wide range of styles of music. I play in a band
            and I enjoy producing music and jamming with my friends in my spare time. For me music is a communal
            process, bringing each unique voice and individual style to form a harmonious whole.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am also passionate about the pursuit of knowledge. I believe that the primary purpose of my life and by
            extension the purpose of human existence is to learn and understand more about the universe. For me there is
            no knowable absolute truth, but through scientific methods we can whittle down the knife of collective
            understanding to get closer and closer to the truth.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"Children are born with a zest for knowledge, aware that they must live in a future molded by science,
                but so often convinced by their culture that science is not for them." - Carl Sagan"</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            However, I think that knowledge does not stand alone. I think knowledge is nothing without teaching,
            communication and expression. Knowledge must be passed on to future generations. I see knowledge as fluid
            like water, flowing through me rather than filling me up. I worked as a tutor at NumberWorks for several
            years while at university. I thoroughly enjoyed this job and it gave me great joy to see the spark of
            understanding in the mind of another person. I want to inspire a passion for learning in those around me as
            best I can. While studying I always felt a desire to work together with my peers and to help them when they
            were stuck. I want to cultivate this love of teaching and mentoring.
        </p>

        <p>
            have always felt an urge to express myself creatively. There is something hugely cathartic about this
            process of creating. Recently I converted a mountain bike into an electric bike. Even this process of
            putting something together following predetermined instructions felt creative. I value the sense of
            accomplishment having made something tangible. I have always been visually oriented and I used to draw and
            design things a lot when I was younger. For me being able to visually see the end result of creation is
            immensely satisfying. I think this is why I am drawn to the UX development and Data Visualization. As I
            mentioned earlier, I enjoy producing and making music with my friends. Even though music is not visual, it
            inspires a similar sense of accomplishment. Music for me is emotionally resonant and through music I can
            express complex emotions that I might otherwise struggle to express.
        </p>

        <p>
            I think creativity is essential when trying to solve problems. The process of synthesizing solutions, even
            when it seems merely technical, is ultimately a creative one. I think this is also true of science where
            speculation and hypothesis is so central to what drives our collective knowledge forward. This is part of
            why I am a big fan of science fiction. This creative speculative thinking is one of the things that draws me
            to technology. I want to be at the forefront of technological development, where fiction and fact are
            colliding.
        </p>

        <h4>a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make</h4> 

        <p>
            Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.
        </p>

        <h4> Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity </h4>

        <p>
            Living in a leafy suburb of central Wellington growing up has definitely influenced my love for nature and
            the environment. I also have always been surrounded by very strong and supportive communities in my family,
            church, and school which has nurtured a love and appreciation of the collective. A strong impact my family
            culture has had on my identity is through my love of science and knowledge. My mother is a librarian/teacher
            and my father is a scientist. They have always encouraged and inspired me to be curious and seek out
            knowledge, but also to think critically and be skeptical of things. More recently as an adult I have been
            surrounded by a very creative, unique, musical and queer friendly community. This has probably influenced by
            identity more than anything else as I have been able to express myself more freely in terms of my non-binary
            gender identity, but also as a creative person.
        </p>

        <h4>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</h4>

        <p>
            I consider myself a good communicator. I did a lot of public speaking at high school and continued debating
            at university. Debating especially allowed me communicate complex ideas quickly on the spot and express
            myself in a highly structured way. I also practiced this skill as a tutor working at NumberWorks. I was
            tutoring a huge range of skill levels, ranging from teaching 5 and 6 year olds to count through to teaching
            year 13 calculus. This demonstrates my ability to communicate adaptively to fit a wide range of different
            audiences. I am adept at Facilitating and coordinating projects and groups. This has been demonstrated
            through organizing music and other community events, bing on the Aro Valley Community Council Committee,
            having a coordination role for group projects at university.
        </p>

        <p>
            the other hand, I need to improve my ability to listen. I consider myself a good communicator, but I often
            find myself getting carried away with trying to get my ideas out, to the detriment of keeping an open mind
            to what others are trying to communicate. This also ties into being able to take criticism and advice from
            others. Sometimes I let my ego and insecurities get in the way of seeing criticism as an opportunity for
            growth and learning. I want to develop my ability to Focus and pay attention to my work. I often find myself
            getting easily distracted and not fully focusing on what I need to be doing. This also relates to my ability
            to manage my time. I sometimes find it hard to plan ahead and ensure I spend enough time working on things
            early so that I am not in a mad rush right at a deadline.
        </p>

        <h4>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.</h4>

        <p>
            I think my strengths of communication and facilitation will be very useful for both learning and career
            development. I hope to use these skills to help me when working in teams and groups. I hope to also use them
            to help others and to take on a mentoring or training role, both at dev academy and also further down the
            track in my career. I think my limited ability to fully listen and engage with others could be an obstacle
            to my learning and also to my career. I need to be able to listen better if I am to get the most out of
            learning. Good Time management and finding a strong focus will also be something that needs to be worked on
            for me to learn better develop a successful career in tech.
        </p>

        <h4>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with
            learning obstacles.</h4>

        <p>
            I think all of my strengths, even the ones I might have neglected to mention here will be carried through my
            learning journey. Communication especially will be very useful. Using my communication skills I will be able
            to ask for help and assistance and voice my concerns about learning obstacles before they become
            overwhelming.
